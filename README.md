PROBLEM

* Counting inventory by hand doesn't adequately capture how inventory flows in real time (i.e.  what guests almost bought, shoplifiting, food waste, etc.)

CONCEPT

* We update a file of item numbers (01-99), quantity-on-hand and unit prices all linked to computer vision models.  

BENEFIT

* When linked to computer vision models, this program sets up neighborhood grocers/corner stores for easy additions, changes, deletions and displays of thier inventory in real time.
